## 📈 THESIS QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Strengths: 💪
- ✅ **Novel findings**: LID speed advantage, Mongolian slowdown
- ✅ **Rigorous methodology**: 312 experiments, reproducible
- ✅ **Complete evaluation**: All 5 RQs answered with data
- ✅ **Honest limitations**: No WER, CPU only - acknowledged
- ✅ **Practical impact**: Actionable recommendations for deployment
- ✅ **Professional presentation**: Figures, tables, clear writing
- ✅ **Reproducible**: All scripts documented and shared

### Areas for Improvement (Acknowledged):
- ⚠️ **No WER/CER**: Lack of reference transcripts (future work)
- ⚠️ **CPU-only**: GPU failed (acknowledged limitation)
- ⚠️ **Limited samples**: 12 per language (reported variance)
- ⚠️ **Short audio only**: ~10-15s clips (scope limitation)

**Overall**: Strong BSc thesis with novel contributions and practical value!
