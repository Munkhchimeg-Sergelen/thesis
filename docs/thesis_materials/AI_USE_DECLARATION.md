## Declaration

I hereby declare that I have used generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools during the preparation of this thesis. This declaration details the extent and purpose of AI use in accordance with the Faculty's guidelines on ethical AI use.

---

## Summary of AI Use

All **research design, experimental work, data analysis, and professional conclusions** were performed by me without AI assistance. Generative AI was used solely for **technical assistance, document formatting, and organizational tasks**, not for generating professional content or research findings.

## Detailed AI Use Documentation

| Section/Task | AI Tool Used | Purpose | Extent of Use |
|--------------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| **Literature Research** | ChatGPT (Claude) | Identifying relevant papers, summarizing ASR concepts | Minor assistance in finding initial references; all cited sources were independently verified |
| **Thesis Structure** | Claude (Anthropic) | Organizing chapter structure, section headings | Assisted in structuring standard thesis format (Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.) |
| **LaTeX Template Setup** | Claude (Anthropic) | Setting up BME LaTeX template, converting Markdown to LaTeX | Technical assistance in extracting template, configuring author information, converting chapter files |
| **Figure Formatting** | Claude (Anthropic) | Fixing LaTeX figure formatting (centering, sizing) | Technical fix to ensure figures fit properly on page with correct width parameters |
| **Documentation** | Claude (Anthropic) | Creating README.md, setup guides | Generated project documentation for GitHub repository |
| **Code Comments** | GitHub Copilot | Suggesting code comments and docstrings | Assistive use in Python evaluation scripts |
| **Proofreading Suggestions** | Claude (Anthropic) | Identifying typos, suggesting clarifications | Minor language editing suggestions (final decisions made by author) |

## Professional Content Created by Author (No AI)

The following core intellectual contributions were produced entirely by me without AI assistance:

1. **Research Design**: 
   - Formulation of 5 research questions
   - Selection of evaluation methodology
   - Choice of models, languages, and dataset

2. **Experimental Work**:
   - Execution of all 312 experiments
   - Configuration of Whisper and Wav2Vec2 models
   - Data collection and preprocessing

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Statistical analysis of results
   - Comparison of LID vs hinted modes
   - Discovery of key findings (LID 2.76× faster, Mongolian 10-30× slower)
   - Interpretation of language inequality patterns

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Development of evaluation scripts (`run_whisper.py`, `run_wav2vec2.py`, etc.)
   - Analysis scripts (`analyze_results.py`, `compare_lid_vs_hinted.py`)
   - Plotting scripts (`create_plots.py`)

5. **Writing and Argumentation**:
   - All research questions, hypotheses, and conclusions
   - Discussion of findings and implications
   - Critical analysis of limitations
   - Recommendations for practitioners

6. **Figures and Visualizations**:
   - All 5 figures created by author using matplotlib
   - Figure design decisions and color schemes
   - Selection of metrics to visualize

## Verification Statement

I confirm that:

1. ✅ All experimental data was collected by me
2. ✅ All analysis and interpretations are my own work
3. ✅ All research conclusions are based on my analysis
4. ✅ AI was used only for technical/formatting assistance
5. ✅ No AI-generated professional content was adopted without verification
6. ✅ All factual statements in the thesis were verified by me
7. ✅ The intellectual contribution and novelty of this thesis are my own

I understand that the use of AI must be ethical and that I am responsible for the correctness of all content in this thesis, regardless of whether AI assisted in its formatting or presentation.

## Supervisor Acknowledgment

I am aware that my supervisor, Dr. Mihajlik Péter, will review this declaration and assess whether the extent of AI use is appropriate for awarding the degree. I am prepared to discuss my work and demonstrate my understanding of all thesis content.

## Notes

- This declaration follows the BME Faculty guidelines on ethical AI use
- All AI use documented here is considered ethical under Faculty policy
- The majority of thesis work (research, experiments, analysis) was human-performed
- AI served in an assistive capacity for technical and formatting tasks only
